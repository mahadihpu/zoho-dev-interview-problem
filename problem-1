Problem:

We have 10+ Deals in the System with Linked Accounts and Contacts. (Please add dummy Data to replicate this). Make sure Accounts has multiple Contact and deal are associated with one
Account but in different Contact
Please do Deluge Codes for the Following  Scenerio

Generate a Output to show Total no of Deals for each Accounts and Contacts
Output will be look like this. For simplicity, we are using Account and Contact ID. No Contact/Account Linked is if Contact/Account is Null
sample_output =  {
                    "Account ID 1": {
                        "total_deal": 5,
                        "Contact id 1": 2,
                        "Contact id 2" 2,
                        "No linked Contact: 1
                    },
                    "Account ID 2": {
                        "total_deal": 35,
                        "Contact id 1": 25,
                        "Contact id 2" 5,
                        "No linked Contact: 5
                    },
                    "Account ID 3": {
                        "total_deal": 15,
                        "Contact id 1": 10,
                        "Contact id 2" 2,
                        "No linked Contact: 3
                    },
                    "No Linked Account Deal" : 10,
                    "No Linked Contact Deal" : 2
                }

Solution:
  


deals = zoho.crm.getRecords("Deals");

account_list = List();
final_list = Map();

for each deal in deals{
	if(account_list.contains(deal.get("Account_Name").get("id")) != true){
		account_id = deal.get("Account_Name").get("id");
		contacts = zoho.crm.getRelatedRecords("Contacts", "Accounts", account_id);
// 		contact_list = List();
		account_list.add(account_id);
		final_list.put(deal.get("Account_Name").get("id"), {
			"total_deal": 1
			});
// 		for each contact in contacts{
// 			final_list.get()
// 		}	
	}
	else{
		total_deal = final_list.get(account_id).get("total_deal");
		final_list.put(account_id, {"total_deal": total_deal + 1});
	}
}

return "";
